# MSN.js
Microsoft Network Instant Messenger emoticons for you and your website<br>
All of these emoticons come from the original MSN files, which is why they are in a spritesheet
# How to use
Put `<script src="https://f46n.org/opn/MSN/MSN.js"></script>` on your HTML files<br>
and use ParseMSN(text) to convert your boring ":)" into "<img src="https://f46n.org/opn/MSN/smile.png">'<br>
